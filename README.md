# DOWNLOADER

This is a program for downloading files or directories off the internet.

Written in java because I FUCKING HATE PYTHON!

Run this on the console by:

-Opening a new cmd window
-Add "java -jar" in the cmd window
-Drag this program to the cmd console
-Press enter

The command should look something like this:

java -jar "CD/WHERE-YOUR-PROGRAM-IS-LOCATED!"

AND ALSO, YOU NEED JAVA INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE!
